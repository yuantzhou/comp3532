<h1>Using a module - View console for results</h1>
<p>Note: modules only work on a server, which means they won't work if you simply open the html file locally. 
   If using an editor such as Visual Code or Brackets, you should be able to 
   find some type of Live Server or Live Preview extension/option that will allow you to test this file.</p>
